# Build - Experimental test for building Elode.js
Just testing Elode.js app, build to HTML CSS and JS code <br>
with bundled script. But something this could be hard to do

## How it works?
Just copy paste the bundled script from Elode.js build() feature <br>
and embed with < link > and < script > on your HTML file.

## The Plan
Need more experiment to do with this feature. Cause there's <br>
some BUG which can be dangerious the performance of your app.
